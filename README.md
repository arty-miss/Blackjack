-  Ace card can have a value of either 1 or 11, depending on circumstance
-  Bust: if you accidentally go over 21, you lose the round

-  Push: if you end up with the same value as the dealer, you win back your bet (eg. if you bet $$10, you win back exactly $10)
-  If you bust, or the dealer has a higher value than you, you win nothing.
-  Natural: if you get a blackjack (21) on your starting 2 cards, you automatically win a 3:2 payout (eg. if you bet $10, you win $25), unless the dealer also ends with 21
